    <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the fifth-largest in our solar system. It's unique in the known universe as the only planet confirmed to support life, primarily due to the presence of liquid water and a breathable atmosphere. Earth is a dynamic planet, with a solid inner and outer core, a mantle, and a crust composed of continents and ocean floors. Here's a more detailed breakdown: Location: Earth is the third planet from the Sun, located in the inner solar system alongside Mercury, Venus, and Mars. Shape: While often depicted as a perfect sphere, Earth is technically a geoid, slightly flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator. Composition: The Earth has a layered structure: a solid inner core, a liquid outer core, a mantle, and a crust. Atmosphere: Earth has a unique atmosphere composed of various gases, including nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide, which is crucial for supporting life. Water: Approximately 71% of Earth's surface is covered by water, mostly in the oceans, which is essential for all known life forms. Life: Earth is the only planet in the universe where life is known to exist, thanks to its ideal conditions of temperature, water, and atmosphere. Movement: Earth has two primary types of motion: rotation (spinning on its axis, causing day and night) and revolution (orbiting the Sun, causing years). Other Names: While "Earth" is the most common name, it's also referred to as "Terra" in some scientific contexts, and the name is used in some languages.
